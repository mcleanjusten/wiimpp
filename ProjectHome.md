Inspired by the PS3 Move controller coming out soon I decided to have my own go at making a 6DOF motion controller for windows.

Using a small bicycle light, a colored plastic ball from a bath thermometer, a Wiimote with Motion Plus and a PS3 Eye camera; A couple of days programming, et VOILÃ€! Le "WiiM++"!

Thanks to Wiibrew, Gl.tter @ WiiYourself!, Alex Popovich, and of course Nintendo & Sony for their kindness and consideration to bring cheap technology to everyday people.
